`gridflare` is a on-demand homelab local streaming service using HLS, video segementation and video.js. 

video.js setup:
`npm i videojs-theme-kit`
`player.on('ready',()=>{ player.theme({skin:'zen'}) })`

scripts:

* lazydown.py : tui, firstly, links are in the form of `link [actual_link_for_video_here]` identifies url and uses `yt-dlp` for `youtube.com/?watch=` links. can also download playlists. for other links uses curl. for `anime [name_of_anime]` uses ani-cli. updates a video.json file with parameter video name, video length, thumbnail (for yt-dlp downloads thumbnails, for others selects a frame). videos are downloaded at video/ and thumbnails at thumbnails/ and video.json in base directory

* html.py : very minimalistic clean site with a grid background, uses `styles.css`

* styles.css : sleek, clean minimal using dark arctic blue, light light blue, white and dark orange.

* script.js: scans videos.json, and displays them, uses a modern video player and full controls. also 10 second previews also exist

* main.py: gets the server up and running, so that a website is produced and other devices can connect and see the videos without actually downloading them.
